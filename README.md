# mumax⁺
A more versatile and extensible GPU-accelerated micromagnetic simulator written in C++ and CUDA with a Python interface. This project is in development alongside its popular predecessor [mumax³](https://github.com/mumax/3).
If you have any questions, feel free to use the [mumax mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/mumax2).

## Paper

mumax⁺ is described in the following paper:
> mumax+: extensible GPU-accelerated micromagnetics and beyond

Please cite this paper if you would like to cite mumax⁺.

## Dependencies
You should install these yourself
* CUDA Toolkit 10.0 or later
* A C++ compiler which supports C++17, such as GCC
* On Windows (good luck): MSVC 2019

These will be installed automatically within the conda environment
* cmake 4.0.0
* Python 3.13
* pybind11 v2.13.6
* NumPy
* matplotlib
* SciPy
* Sphinx

## Installation from Source

### Linux

Make sure that the following applications and build tools are installed:
* C++ compiler which supports c++17, such as GCC
* CPython *(version ≥ 3.8 recommended)* and pip 
* CUDA Toolkit *(version 10.0 or later)*
* git
* miniconda or anaconda

Make especially sure that everything CUDA-related (like `nvcc`) can be found inside your path. This can be done by editing your `~/.bashrc` file and adding the following lines.
```bash
# add CUDA
export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```
The paths might differ if CUDA Toolkit has been installed in a different location. If successful, a command such as `nvcc --version` should work.

Clone the mumax⁺ git repository. The `--recursive` flag is used here to get the pybind11 submodule which is needed to build mumax⁺.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mumax/plus.git mumaxplus && cd mumaxplus
```
We recommend to install mumax⁺ in a clean conda environment. You could also skip this step and use your own conda environment instead if preferred.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mumaxplus
```
Then build and install mumax⁺ using pip.
```bash
pip install -v .
```
If changes are made to the code, then ``pip install -v .`` can be used to
rebuild mumax⁺. If you want to change the Python code without needing
to reinstall, you can use ``pip install -ve .``.

You could also compile the source code with double precision, by changing `FP_PRECISION` in `CMakeLists.txt` from `SINGLE` to `DOUBLE` before rebuilding.
```cmake
add_definitions(-DFP_PRECISION=DOUBLE) # FP_PRECISION should be SINGLE or DOUBLE
```

### Windows

**These instructions are old and worked at some point (2021), but not today. If you are brave enough to try Windows and you manage to get it working, please let us know!**

1. Install Visual Studio 2019 and the desktop development with C++ workload
2. Install CUDA Toolkit 10.x
3. Install cmake
4. Download the pybind11 submodule with git
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
5. Install Python packages using conda
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
6. Build `mumaxplus` using `setuptools`
```
activate mumaxplus
python setup.py develop
```
or `conda`
```
conda activate mumaxplus
conda develop -b .
```

## Building the documentation

Documentation for mumax⁺ can be found at http://mumax.github.io/plus.
It follows the [NumPy style guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) and is generated using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org). You can build it yourself by running the following command in the `docs/` directory:
```bash
make html
```
The documentation can now be found at `docs/_build/html/index.html`.

## Examples

Lots of example codes are located in the `examples/` directory. They are either simple Python scripts, which can be executed inside said directory like any Python script
```bash
python standardproblem4.py
```
or they are interactive notebooks (`.ipynb` files), which can be run using Jupyter.

## Testing

Several automated tests are located inside the `test/` directory. Type `pytest` inside the terminal to run them. Some are marked as `slow`, such as `test_mumax3_standardproblem5.py`. You can deselect those by running `pytest -m "not slow"`. Tests inside the `test/mumax3/` directory require external installation of mumax³. They are marked by `mumax3` and can be deselected in the same way.
