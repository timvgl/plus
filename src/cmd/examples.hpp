/** Ferromagnetic spinwave dispersion relation.
 *
 * Disregarding dipole-dipole interactions, the dispersion relation f(k) in a
 * ferromagnetic wire is given by
 *
 * f(k) = (gamma / 2 * pi) * ((2A / M_s) * k^2 + B)
 *
 * with A the exchange stiffness, M_s the saturation magnetization, and B an
 * externally applied field. We will try to reproduce this dispersion relation
 * numerically using mumax.
 *
 * The mumax script below simulates a uniformly magnetized nanowire with an
 * applied field perpendicular to the wire. Spin waves are excited by a sinc
 * pulse with a maximum frequency of 20GHz at the center of the simulation box.
 * Note that the demagnetization is disabled in this simulation.
